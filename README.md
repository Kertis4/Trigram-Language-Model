# Trigram-Language-Model
An academic Assignment I fell in love with, creating a Trigram Language Model (TLM)
This project is one that gave me a much greater understanding of how LLMs work by getting my hands dirty
This involved a lot of problem-solving and using the Probability theory through NumPy


I received the grade A+ for this project with the note -- Outstanding Work

The file consists of a:

- Unigram Language model which picks words completely at random
- Bigram Language Model which uses the conditional probability of the following word in order to generate a sentence
- Trigram Language Model which calculates the conditional probability of the words following the bigram in order to generate a sentence
